can you write an html page, that shows a random question for the user with answer options to the user from the following collection, and if the user selects the correct question, add 100 points to his points tally

if the user answers in a streak (IE previous question was also correct), add 10 more points for each correct answer in the streak

, and show the user a different question he did not answer correctly. If the user answers incorrectly, show him a different question and reduce a life from his life tally (starts at 3). when the user's life is 0, stop showing questions, show the score tally and write please refresh to start again
